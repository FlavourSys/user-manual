###########################
Configuring the Mint client
###########################

After you have completed the setup of the |product| server, you will need to install 
and configure the |product| client on each of your editing stations. 

*************************
Download and installation
*************************

Open your web browser of choice and enter the IP address or hostname of the |product| server 
in the address bar, followed by ``/download``, for example ``http://192.168.0.10/download``. 
The server will automatically send you the correct installer program for your operating 
system. Open the installer and complete the installation procedure as usual. After the 
installation has finished, fire up the client application to start the configuration.

.. note:: 
  The server determines your operating system based on the web browser's ``USER_AGENT``
  setting. If it fails to deliver the installer, you can also find it in the ``setups``
  directory within the server installation directory.

*****************************************
Initial Configuration (Microsoft Windows)
*****************************************

To start the client, choose **Mint Client** from the **FlavourSys** folder in the 
Windows start menu. Since the client has not been run before, this will automatically 
bring up the configuration wizard, which will guide you through the configuration 
process.

===================
Basic Configuration
===================

On its first page, the wizard will ask you for some basic settings.
