A Mint project consists of a file level container which can include certain file objects. At the same time this project is a part of a database in order to control several metadata operations.

A Mint project on the file level can include:

* Project files from different editing/compositing applications such as Avid Media Composer 
* Different types of media files (\*.mov, \*.mxf. \*.omf, etc.)
* Discs and cartridges from different cameras (XDCAM EX, P2, Red One, etc.)
* AMA objects
* And more..

A Mint project on the metadata level includes:

* A project name
* A project template
* Relation of the project to other projects

A project is read and writable for who opened it.

A subproject is a project added to another project. It has the same properties as a project but it is read only for the editor who added it to his or her opened project.

A subproject is read only for who opened it.
