Sorting Projects and Assets
***********************

Within the Project Pane, you can sort projects by 

* Project/Asset Name (Name)
* Physical Size (Size)
* Creation Date (Created)

To sort your projects or assets based upon one of these criteria enable the "projects" checkbox below the search field (disable the "assets" checkbox) and click on "Name", "Size" or "Created". If you sort by one of these values click the value again to reverse the order of the search results in an Ascending or Descending manner.


***********************
Expanding/Contract Project Pane
***********************

To see the asset content of a project in the project list click on the arrow on the left to the project name. Strawberry will load the first 150 assets of the project sorted by name. For projects containing more than 150 assets, if you scroll down the asset list you will recognize a message saying "You have reached the maximum amount of displayable assets in this view. Click "View All Assets" to switch the view." Click this button to let Strawberry load all the assets from this project. To contract the project ("hide" its assets) imply click on the arrow on the left of the project name again.
